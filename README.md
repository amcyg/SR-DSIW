# SlideRule Data Science Intensive Workshop

This repository is where I'll be experimenting with various data sets as part of the SlideRule Data Science Intensive Workshop, a self-paced data science course. More details about the program can be found [here](https://www.mysliderule.com/workshops/data-science-intensive/). While most data sets will be sourced through the road map offered by the program, I may also include practice projects from other sources (Github, PyCon conferences, MOOCs, open source tutorials, etc.) and will give credit where it's due.

A final index of all projects will be forthcoming!
